# 🤖 AI Course Assignments Repository

Welcome to my repository for assignments completed during the **Artificial Intelligence course**. This collection covers a wide range of foundational and advanced topics in AI, including:

- 🧠 Machine Learning (ML)
- 🧬 Deep Learning (DL)
- 🌀 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- 🎯 Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- 🔗 Neural Networks
- 🐍 Python implementations

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym (for RL)
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 🎓 Purpose

These assignments were designed to:
- Reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation
- Explore real-world datasets and modeling techniques
- Build intuition for tuning, optimization, and evaluation
- Encourage experimentation with cutting-edge architectures

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Course-Assignments-2025.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Course-Assignments-2025
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
